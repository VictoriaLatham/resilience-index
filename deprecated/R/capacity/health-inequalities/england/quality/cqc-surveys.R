# Info ----

# Number of surveys on CQC site: https://www.cqc.org.uk/publications/surveys/surveys
# Some are for 2020: 1. adult inpatient, 2. urgent & emergency care, 3. COVID inpatient, 4. Community mental health
# As at 11/21 others further in past (and so not included): 1. Maternity (2019), 2, Children & young people (2018), 3. Ambulance (2013/14), 4. Outpatient (2011)
# The COVID inpatient survey did not split by trust so have not included.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: Documentation states some of the currently out of date surveys will become available for 2020 at end of 2021 so might able to be added to the RI https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/20211020%20Website%20forward%20programme%20v89.odt

# For each of these surveys there is data at trust level (the scores are calculated by comparing trusts against each other, rather than absolute performance).
# Within each survey there are a variety of specific questions about performance but there is one ‘overall’ question where rate experience (on scale 0 to 10) so only extract this answer.
# Need to examine each survey in turn to determine which question number it is
# (may need to check in future refreshes the question numbers still align, as in data only refers to the question number, not what is being asked).

# Each survey dataset has a sheet (roughly named) 'Trust_Respondents' with the demographic info on the respondents to the survey and 'Trust_Scores' with the summary of scores.
# The survey questions can be found linked in the 'Further information' section of the front page of the datasets (then 'Survey Materials' section of linked page)

# Notes on the trust level scores:
# Weights were calculated to adjust for any variation between trusts that resulted from differences in the age, sex and route of admission groupings of respondents.
# The reason for weighting the data was that respondents may answer questions differently, depending on certain characteristics
