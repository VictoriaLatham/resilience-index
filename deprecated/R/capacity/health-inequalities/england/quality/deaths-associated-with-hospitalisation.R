# 122 trusts

# There is data for only 122 trusts (but there is over 200 open trusts) - this is because data is only available for non-specialist acute trusts (see below)
# Also have done a check of this at end of script (under 'Extra checks' section) by loading in trust inspection categories from CQC data to confirm.

# Source of below quote on coverage of data: https://files.digital.nhs.uk/2C/498A3E/SHMI%20background%20quality%20report%2C%20Jul20-Jun21.pdf
# The SHMI methodology has been designed for non-specialist acute trusts. Specialist trusts,
# mental health trusts, community trusts and independent sector providers are excluded from
# the SHMI because there are important differences in the case-mix of patients treated there
# compared to non-specialist acute trusts and the SHMI has not been designed for these types
# of trusts.

# From https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/shmi/2021-11:
# The SHMI is the ratio between the actual number of patients who die following hospitalisation at the trust and the number
# that would be expected to die on the basis of average England figures, given the characteristics of the patients treated there.
# It covers patients admitted to hospitals in England who died either while in hospital or within 30 days of being discharged.
# Deaths related to COVID-19 are excluded from the SHMI.
