# ---- Method ----
# The build method is adapted from the methods used to develop the Health Index
# for England. As the devolved nations versions of the Health Index are not
# measured across time, several aspects of the construction differ, and mirror
# those found in the Indices of Multiple Deprivation.

# Steps:
#   1. Scale (align) indicators so that higher value = higher capacity.
#   2. Missing step: Apply functional transformations (e.g. log, square) to
#      address skewness in the distributions.
#   3. Normalise to mean of 0 and SD +-1.
#   4. Optional step: Weight the indicators within domains: apply MFLA.
#   5. Calculate domain scores: add together normalised indicator scores
#      (weighted or unweighted) and rank and qunatise.
#   6. Combine domains with equal weighting to produce composite score: rank
#      and quantise output.









# ******************************************************************************
# TODO: Before the index can be built, the scaling of indicators needs
#       establishing. Currently some indicators use `calculate_extent_depreciated()`, and 
#       set 1 to equal pockets of low capacity, meaning they would need scaling
#       in the build script by multiplying by negative one. Does this make
#       sense, and if not, where should the inversion/scaling take place?
